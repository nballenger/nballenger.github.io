1. For the k-th attribute, compute a similarity, sk(x,y) in range [0,1]
2. Define an indicator variable, delta-k, for the k-th attribute:

            | 0  if the kth attribute is an asymmetric attribute and
            |    both objects have a value of 0, or if one of the
    delta-k |    objects has a missing value for the k-th attribute
            | 
            | 1  otherwise
            
3. Compute the overall similarity between the two objects using the 
   following fomula:
   
                      sum of (weight-k * delta-k * std-dev-k(x,y)), 1 to n
    similarity(x,y) = ----------------------------------------------------
                                  sum of delta-k for 1 to n

    covariance matrix S
        * Spread measure for data with continuous variables.
        * Covariance is a measure of the degree to which two attributes vary
          together, though correlation is preferred for judging the degree of
          that relationship.
        * The ij-th entry s-ij is the covariance of the i-th and j-th attributes
          of the data.
        
            s-ij = covariance(xi,xj)

        * The diagonals are correlation(xi,xi) = 1, while other entries vary
          between 0 and 1.
          
    skewness
        * Measurement of the degree to which the values are symmetrically 
          distributed around the mean.

          that object, and then connecting the endpoints with lines to form a
          polygon. The form and size of the polygon indicate the data.

    ACCENT Principles
        * Apprehension: Ability to correctly perceive relations among variables.
          Does the graph maximize apprehension of the relations among variables?
        * Clarity: Ability to visually distinguish all the elements of a graph.
          Are the most important elements or relations visually most prominent?
        * Consistency: Ability to interpret a graph based on similarity to 
          previous graphs. Are the elements, symbol shapes, and colors consistent
          with their use in previous graphs?
        * Efficiency: Ability to portray a possibly complex relation in as simple
          a way as possible. Are the elements of the graph economically used? Is
          the graph easy to interpret?
        * Necessity: The need for the graph, and the graphical elements. Is the
          graph a more useful way to represent the data than alternatives? Are
          all the graph elements necessary to convey the relations?
        * Truthfulness: Ability to determine the true value represented by any
          graphical element by its magnitude relative to the implicit or explicit
          scale. Are the graph elements accurately positioned and scaled?

    Hunt's algorithm
        * Decision tree induction algorithm that grows a tree in a recursive
          fashion by partitioning the training records into successively purer
          subsets.
        * Algorithm:
        
            Let:
                Dt = the set of training records associated with node t
                y = {y1, y2, ...,yc} = class labels
                
            Step 1:
                If all the records in Dt belong to the same class yt, then t
                is a leaf node labeled as yt.
            Step 2:
                If Dt contains records that belong to more than one class, an
                attribute test condition is selected to partition the records
                into smaller subsets. A child node is created for each outcome
                of the test condition and the records in Dt are distributed to
                the children based on the outcomes. The algorithm is then
                recursively applied to each child node.
                
        * Special conditions:
            1.  Some child nodes can be created that have no records associated
                with them. This can happen if none of the training records have
                the combination of attribute values associated with that node.
                If this happens, the node is declared a leaf node with the same
                class label as the majority class of training records associated
                with its parent node.
            2.  If all the records associated with Dt have identical attribute
                values (except for the class label), then it is not possible to
                split these records any further. In this case, the node is
                declared a leaf node with the same class label as the majority
                class of training records associated with the node.
                
    Designing for Decision Tree Induction
        1.  How should the training records be split? Each step must select an
            attribute test condition to divide the records into smaller subsets.
            To implement this, the algorithm must provide a method for specifying
            the test condition for different attribute types as well as an
            objective measure for evaluating the goodness of each test condition.
        2.  How should the splitting procedure stop? A stopping condtion is
            needed to terminate the tree growing process. A possible strategy
            is to continue expnading a node until either all the records belong
            to the same class or all the records have identical attribute values.
            Although both conditions are sufficient to stop any decision tree
            induction algorithm, other criteria can be imposed to allow the
            tree growing procedure to terminate earlier.
            
    attribute test condition
        * A way of testing an attribute to split records into separate classes.
        
    binary attribute test condition
        * Generates two potential outcomes
        
    nominal attribute test condition
        * One outcome per distinct value of the corresponding attribute.
        * Alternately, binary splits only by considering all 2^k-1 - 1 ways of
          creating a binary partition of k attribute values.
          
    ordinal attribute test condition
        * Can produce binary or multiway splits.
        * Can be grouped if the grouping does not violate the order property of
          the attribute values.
          
    continuous attributes
        * Can be expressed as a comparison test (A < v | A > v) with binary
          outcomes, or a range query with intervals.
        * For a multiway split, deriving split points may require discretization
        
    impurity tests
        * Let p(i|t) denote the fraction of records belonging to class i at a
          given node t. The class distribution before splitting is (0.5,0.5), 
          because there are an equal number of records from each class. If we
          split the data on an attribute, the class distribution may change.
          Comparing different splits based on the purity (closeness to (0,1))
          of their child nodes, we choose the split with the lowest impurity.
        * Measures of impurity include:
        
                             c-1
            Entropy(t) =  -&Sigma; p(i|t) log2 p(i|t)
                             i=0
                             
                            c-1
            Gini(t) = 1 - &Sigma; [p(i|t)]^2
                            i=0
                            
                           
            Classification error(t) = 1 - max[p(i|t)]
                                           i
                                           
            where c = number of classes and 0 log2 0 = 0 in entropy calculations
            
        * To determine how well a test condition performs, we need to compare
          the degree of impurity of the parent node (before splitting) with the 
          degree of impurity of the child nodes (after splitting). The larger
          the difference, the better the test condition.
        * The gain, &Delta;, can determine the goodness of a split:
        
                                     k    N(vj)
            &Delta; = I(parent) - &Sigma; ----- I(vj)
                                    j=1     N
                                    
            Where:
                I()     = impurity measure of a given node
                N       = total number of records at the parent node
                k       = number of attribute values
                N(vj)   = number of records at the child node
                
    splitting continuous attributes
        * Order the values of the dataset.
        * Compute the impurity of midpoints between adjacent values.
        * For improved performance, consider only candidate split points between
          adjacent numbers that have different classes.
          
    gain ratio
        * Impurity measures tend to favor attributes with large numbers of
          distinct values. Choosing between gender, car type, and zip code, for
          instance, would tend to favor zip code.
        * Two strategies for dealing with this problem:
            - Restrict test conditions to binary splits only.
            - Modify the splitting criterion to take into account the number of
              outcomes produced by the attribute test condition, as with gain
              ratio, which is:
            
                            &Delta; info
              Gain ratio = --------------
                             Split Info
                             
              where
                                 k
                Split Info = -&Sigma; P(vi) log2 P(vi)
                                i=1
                                
                with k being the total number of splits.
                
    Algorithm for Decision Tree Induction
        * Input consists of the training records E and the attribute set F.
        * Works by recursively selecting the best attribute to split the data
          and expanding the leaf nodes of the tree until the stopping criterion
          is met.
        * Algorithm:
        
            TreeGrowth(E,F)
                if stopping_cond(E,F) = true then
                    leaf = createNode()
                    leaf.label = Classify(E)
                    return leaf
                else
                    root = createNode()
                    root.test_cond = find_best_split(E,F)
                    let V = {v|v is a possible outcome of root.test_cond}
                    for each v in V do
                        Ev = {e | root.test_cond(e) = v and e in E}
                        child = TreeGroth(Ev, F)
                        add child as descendent of root
                        label the edge (root --> child) as v
                    end for
                end if
                return root
    
    data fragmentation problem
        * When the leaf nodes of a decision tree are too small to make a
          statistically significant decision about the class representation
          of the nodes.
        * One approach is to disallow further splitting when the number of 
          records falls below a threshold.
          
    subtree replication problem
        * When the same test is repeated multiple places throughout the tree.
        
    decision boundary
        * The border between two neighboring regions of different classes.
        * Boundaries considering one attribute are rectilinear WRT the axes of
          a 2d graph, and can't adequately partition all datasets.
          
    oblique decision tree
        * Means of overcoming limitations of single-attribute tests.
        * Allows test conditions involving more than one attribute.
        * Finding the optimal test condition for a node can be expensive.
        
    constructive induction
        * Another method for partitioning data into homogeneous, nonrectangular
          regions. Uses composite attributes representing arithmetic or logical
          combinations of existing attributes.
        
    training error / resubstitution error / apparent error
        * The number of misclassification errors committed on training records.
        
    generalization error
        * Expected error of the model on previously unseen records.
        
    model overfitting
        * When the classification model has a low training error but a higher
          generalization error, it may indicate the model is too specific to the
          training data set.
        * Can be caused by noise in the training data.
        * Can be caused by lack of representative samples.
        * Can be caused by multiple comparison procedure: when an individual
          data combination is unlikely to occur, but quite likely to occur in
          repeated comparisons of individual items. Problematic when the decision
          being made is whether to further extend a tree--any single attribute
          being good enough to extend the tree is unlikely (at some terminal point)
          but at least one of them being "best" is extremely likely to occur.
        * As model complexity increases, overfitting becomes more likely. 
          
    model underfitting
        * The training and test error rates are high when the size of the tree
          is very small. Underfitting occurs because the model has yet to learn
          the true structure of the data. As the number of nodes increases, there
          will be fewer training and test errors.
                  
    tree pruning
        * Reducing the size of the decision tree to prevent overfitting.
        
    Occam's Razor / principle of parsimony
        * Given two models with the same generalization errors, the simpler 
          model is preferred over the more complex model.
          
    minimum description length principle
        * Two parties, A and B, are given a set of records with known attribute
          values x. A knows the exact class label for each record, B does not.
          B can get classifications from A by having A transmit labels 
          sequentially, requiring theta(n) bits of information, where n is the
          number of records.
        * Alternatively, A could build a classification model that summarizes
          the relationship between x and y. The model can be encoded and 
          transmitted to B. If the model is 100% accurate, the cost of 
          transmission is equivalent to the cost of encoding the model.
          Otherwise, A must also transmit information about which record is
          incorrectly classified.
        * The overall cost of transmission is:
        
            Cost(model, data) = Cost(model) + Cost(data|model)
            
          where Cost(model) is the cost to encode the model, and Cost(data|model)
          is the cost to encode mislabeled records.
        * MDL says you should seek a model that minimizes the overall cost function.
        
    generalization error as upper bound of training error
        * Statistical correction to derive generalization error from training 
          error is computed as an upper bound of the training error, taking into
          account the number of training records reaching a particular leaf node.
          
    validation set
        * Divide the training data into two smaller subsets, and use one for
          estimating the generalization error from the training error.
          
    prepruning / early stopping
        * Stopping tree growth before a fully grown tree is produced.
        * A more restrictive stopping condition is used.
        * EG: stop expanding a leaf node when the observed gain in impurity falls
          below a certain threshold.
          
    post-pruning
        * Initially grow the tree to maximum size.
        * Then trim the tree in a bottom up fashion.
        * Methods:
            1.  Replacing a subtree with a new leaf node whose class label is
                determined from the majority class of records of the subtree.
            2.  Replacing a subtree with the most frequently used branch of the
                subtree.
                
Evaluating the Performance of a Classifier

    model selection
        * Finding a model of the right complexity that is not susceptible to
          overfitting.
          
    holdout method (evaluation of a classifier)
        * Original data with labeled examples is partitioned into two disjoint
          sets, called training and test sets. A classification model is then
          induced from the training set, and its performance is evaluated on
          the test set.
        * Limitations of the method: 
            1.  The test set takes labeled examples away from the training set.
            2.  Model may be highly dependent on the makeup of those two sets,
                since the smaller the training set the larger the model variance.
            3.  The training and test sets are no longer independent of each other.
            
    random subsampling (evaluation of a classifier)
        * Repeating the holdout method several times to improve the
          estimation of a classifier's performance
          
    cross-validation (evaluation of a classifier)
        * Each record is used the same number of times for training and exactly
          once for testing. For instance, split the initial subset equally, then
          use one for training and one for test, then swap them.
        * k-fold cross-validation segments the data into k equal sized portions.
          During each run, one of the partitions is chosen for testing, while the
          rest are used for testing exactly once. Process is repeated k times, so
          that each partition is used for testing exactly once. The error is
          found by summing the errors for all k runs.
          
    leave-one-out approach to cross validation
        * Running k-fold cross validation with k = N, where N is the size of
          the data set.
        * Utilizes as much data as possible for training, but is usually
          computationally expensive.
          
    bootstrap (evaluation of a classifier)
        * Sampling the training records with replacement. Records not included
          in the bootstrap sample are part of the test set. The model induced
          from the training set is then applied to the test set to obtain an
          accuracy measure. The bootstrap is then repeated b times, for an
          accuracy of:
          
                     b
            1/b * &Sigma; (0.632 * ei + 0.368 * acc-s)
                    i=1
                    
          where acc-s is the accuracy computed from a training set that contains
          all the labeled examples in the original data set. 0.632 is the 
          asymptotic limit of the percent of a set that will be sampled by
          selection with replacement.
          
Methods for Comparing Classifiers
    * Observed difference in accuracy between two classifiers may not be
      statistically significant.

Chapter 5: Classification: Alternative Techniques

    Rule Based Classifer
        * Technique for classification using a collection of if-then rules.
        * Rules describe disjunct segments.
        
    rule antecedent / precondition
        * The logical test to perform.
        
    rule consequent
        * Output class of the test.
        
    coverage
        * Quality measure for classification rules.
        * The fraction of records in a data set D that trigger the rule r.
        
            Coverage(r) = |A| / |D|
            
    accuracy / confidence factor
        * The fraction of records triggered by r whose class labels equal y
        
            Accuracy(r) = |A intersect y| / |A|
            
          where |A| is the number of records that satisfy the rule antecedent,
          |A intersect y| is the number that satisfy both the antecdent and the
          consequent, and |D| is the total number of records.
          
    mutually exclusive rules
        * Rules in R are mutually exclusive if no two rules in R are triggered
          by the same record.
          
    exhaustive rules
        * R has exhaustive coverage if there is a rule for each combination of
          attribute values, ensuring that every record is covered by at least
          one rule in R.
          
    ordered rules
        * Rules in R are ordered in decreasing order of priority, so if a
          record would trigger multiple rules, it is claimed by the first one
          it triggers in priority order.
          
    unordered rules
        * All triggered rules for a record are counted as 'votes' toward a
          classification. Vote may be weighted by the rule's accuracy.
          
    rule based ordering scheme
        * Order is by a measure of rule quality
    
    class-based ordering scheme
        * Rules that belong to the same class appear grouped together in R.
        
Methods of Rule Extraction
    
    sequential covering algorithm
        * Used to extract rules directly from data.
        * Rules are extracted one class at a time for non-binary classed rulesets.
        * Algorithm:
        
            Let:
                E  = training records
                A  = set of attribute value pairs {(Aj,vj)}
                Yo = ordered set of classes {y1,y2,...,yk}
                R  = {}, empty initial rule list
                
            for each class y in Yo - {yk} do
                while stopping condition is not met do
                    r <- Learn-One-Rule (E,A,y)
                    Remove training records from E that are covered by r
                    Add r to the bottom of the rule list: R -> R and v
                end while
            end for
            Insert the default rule, {} -> yk, to the bottom of R
            
    Learn-One-Rule Function
        * Attempts to extract a classification rule that covers many of the
          positive examples in the training set.
        * Generates an initial rule r and refines it until the stop condition
          is met. The rule is then pruned to improve its generalization error.
