<h1>Electrolysis Resources</h1>
<p>These are a few things I've found useful.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://1bad6t.com/rust_removal.html" target="_blank"><i>Rust Removal using Electrolysis</i></a> from 1bad6t.com has a useful setup for a 5 gallon bucket rig. Don't worry about tack welding the rebar, you can really just connect them with annealed wire, as long as you can keep them steady against the side of the bucket.</li>
  <li><a href="http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/andyspatch/rust.htm" target="_blank"><i>Rust Removal Using Electrolysis</i></a> by Andrew Westcott goes deeper into the chemistry, with a bit more of a focus on conservation uses.</li>
  <li><a href="http://davehallier.com/best-charger-for-rust-removal-by-electrolysis" target="_blank"><i>Best Charger for Rust Removal by Electrolysis</i></a> by Dave Hallier turned me on to the Schumacher charger that I have.</li>
  <li><a href="http://wwwchem.uwimona.edu.jm/courses/iron.html" target="_blank"><i>Some chemistry of Iron</i></a> from the chem department at the University of the West Indies has some good (to my untrained eye, it's fairly technical) info on the actual oxidation and redox reactions that make rust happen and electrolysis function.</li>
</ul>
